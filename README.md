# An Analysis of Movie Performance

In this part, you'll gather data on popular movies from the last decade.

### Part 1: Data Gathering
1. Start by scraping the [Best Actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor) and [Best Actress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress) Wikipedia pages. Clean the data you gather and save the results into a csv file.
2. Next, scrape the [Best Picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture) and again save the results to a csv.
3. Sign up for an [TMDB account](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). Use their API to find, for each year of the last decade (2015-2024), the top 100 movies in terms of number of votes. For each of those movies, gather the gense, budget, and revenue. Make sure that the data you gather includes each of the Best Picture nominees.
4. Finally, for each actor and actress, pull their movie credits.
