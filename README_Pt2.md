# An Analysis of Movie Performance, Part 2

In this part, you'll analyze the data that you gathered.

### Part 2: Analysis
1. Examine your dataset to answer questions such as:  
* How popular is each genre?
* How much do movies tend to make? Adjust the budget and revenue metrics for inflation.
* Do certain genres perform better than others?

2. Performance comparisons: Investigate whether:  
* Movies nominated for or winning Best Picture tend to perform better than those that didn’t.  
* Movies featuring a Best Actor or Best Actress winner tend to perform better than those that didn’t.  

Prepare a 10-12 minute presentation of your findings. This presentation should focus on the exploratory analysis and statistical modeling portions of this project and not on the webscraping components. Thus, you should not include any code in your presenation. Your presentation should be done using PowerPoint/Google Slides or other presentation software.

Presentations will take place on Tuesday, 11/25 at noon.
